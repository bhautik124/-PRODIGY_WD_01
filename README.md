I have successfully completed task 1 of my internship, which involved creating an interactive navigation menu. This menu changes color or style when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item. The menu is fixed in position and visible on all pages, utilizing HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
